# Linear Regression on Life Expectancy Data

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of the **Linear Regression** model on life expectancy data obtained from **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)**. The task is to predict life expectancy based on various features such as cities and gender, allowing for continuous value predictions.

## Project Contents
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes life expectancy data for cities in Turkey, segmented by gender.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and preparing the dataset for regression modeling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of a **Linear Regression** model to predict life expectancy based on the available features.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared** to assess the prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LinearReg-Life-Expectancy.git
